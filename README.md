# Bowling - OnSharp Challenge

Hello again,</br>

Thank you for giving me some extra time to work on this.</br>

I ended up rebuilding it in a new solution to make things easier on myself, so that's why everything was swapped in my recent commit.</br>

For this I was able to:</br>
-Get the running total to work</br>
-Simplify it to only being composed of a Round object with many Frame objects (no balls), and the helper classes</br>
-Abstract out a lot of the functionality for better testing capabilities</br>
-Write a lot more test cases for classes</br>
</br>
Some things to note:</br>
-In the interest of time and it being only a coding challenge, I did not fully complete all possible tests.</br>
-The most complete test class is for "NormalFrameTests" in the "Frames" test folder</br>
</br>

I would be more than happy to continue getting the test cases up, but I feel as though what I have done now (in NormalFrameTests) is a good indication of what things could be if I were to continue that process. Plus, since this is only a coding challenge, I'm not sure how indepth the test suite should be/needs to be. :) If you would rather me fully complete all tests, let me know and I'll be happy to do that as soon as I can.</br>
</br>
If you have any comments or concerns, please reach out to me. I also would greatly appreciate any feedback on it to help me improve.</br></br>
Thank you for your time,</br>
-Brian
